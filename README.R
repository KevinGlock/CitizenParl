## This is the annex repository belonging to my Bachelor´s thesis "The parliamentary discourse on citizenship in Germany between 1996 and 2016".
## The repository includes all relevant code to replicate the whole analysis steps.


## Research target

## The aim of the analysis is to explain potential convergences and divergences in parliamentary parties´ contextualisation on citizenship.
## It is assumed that the immigration rate and its salience effect on speech frequencies can affect parties contextualisation
## Therefore the analysis focuses on long-term frequencies of key-word-in-contexts.
## The long-term correlation between immigration rate and speech frequencies on citizenship topics in the German Bundestag is analysed.
## Further, describtive time-series is applied to get the wider contexts.
## The next part includes the focus on its collocations of ngram-combinations to find the significant part-of-speech-combinations of parliamentary parties to compare the narrow contexts.
## To identify lingustic and ideologic convergences and divergences over time and between the parliamentary parties the qualitative context is evaluated.
## In a previously done study a dictionary including relevant terms of citizenship discourse was deductively formulated.
## Related to the theoretical model, the dictionary contains terms referring to actors, issues, and norms of citizenship aspects.


## Three research questions will be followed:

## To what extent has the contextualization of the concept of citizenship in plenary debates of the Fed-eral Republic of Germany on federal level changed between 1996 and 2016?

## How does the total immigration correspond to the discourse on citizenship illustrated by political ac-tors at the federal level?

## To what extend do imagination and linguistic contextualisation of dual citizenship differ between par-liamentary groups and its speaking members in parliament?


## Two hypotheses were tested:

## H1: When the total immigration rate raises, the relative frequency of terms related to the citizenship context will increase. The higher the immigration rate increase, the higher frequencies will raise on average.
##     r > 0; rho > 0

## H2: Relative percentages of dual citizenship aspects contextualised with identity frames of progressive, transnational, or multicultural (conservative, nationalistic, or racist) references are higher for political parties who are classified as left-wing (right-wing) parties and vis visa.
##     For CDU/CSU := x%conservative - x%progressive > 0
##     For other parties := x%progressive - x%conservative > 0
