# Subsetting the corpus into two corpora of interest (right and left, conservative and progressive regarding transnational and national models)
# and all other analysis steps are now valid workflows, instead of some little issues.
# First empirical results are:
# relative frequencies of occuring citizenship nodes from the dictionary and the total immigration rate are highly correlated on some .60.
# The discourse had changed from issues of Ethnic German resettlers and DDR-citizen´s naturalisation aspects to border issues, deportation as well as flight and asylum.
# The tone used by parliamentary parties is in general neutral instead of some rethoric.
# Convergence between parties is present, but divergences exist regarding dual citizenship, identity issues of citizenship
# and the naturalisation process, even so border issues are highly debated.
